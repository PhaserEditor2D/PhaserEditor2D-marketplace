A point-and-click game.

It shows how you can use the Script Nodes for implementing the behavior of buttons
and other interactive objects.

It is based on Phaser 3, Webpack 5, TypeScript, and Phaser Editor 2D v3.

You can [play it here](https://phasereditor2d.github.io/starter-example-a-day-in-the-beach/).
